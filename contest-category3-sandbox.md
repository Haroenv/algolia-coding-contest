## Solve a problem! 
Company ABC has asked you to revamp their existing search interface. 

Their only requirement is that it includes [Autocomplete](https://autocomplete.algolia.com/). 

### The contest

To participate:

- Start with the following Codesandbox:
https://codesandbox.io/s/autocomplete-starter-lobbu

- Fork this sandbox
- Make all coding changes in your forked version
- Submit the final version of your sandbox

You have **two options** in terms of how you can improve the sandbox: 
1. A great UI
2. Multiple data sources.

#### Option 1 - Create a great autocomplete UI

Implement an **instant results, autocomplete experience**, which means that users see results instantly, as they type.
For this option, you can use the data that's already plugged into the Sandbox. The goal is to add great functionality and design to your implementation.

Here are some inspiring examples:
- [docs](https://www.algolia.com/doc/)
- [docsearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/)

Take a look at this article on [how to implement Autocomplete](https://www.algolia.com/blog/ux/taking-documentation-search-to-new-heights-with-algolia-and-autocomplete/).


#### Option 2 - Plug in multiple data sources 

Focus on the data: plug in your own service(s) and add multiple data sources to the Autocomplete library. Be creative - you can use sources that add social networks, products from diverse catalogs, and multiple sources of streaming services, such as GitHub API, YouTube API, [Algolia](https://github.com/algolia/datasets), [Locations](https://index.okfn.org/dataset/postcodes/), etc..
 
You can find out more about combining multiple sources in our guide on [federated search](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/solutions/ecommerce/autocomplete/tutorials/federated-search/).

The most interesting use case for multiple data sources wins! You will be judged on the creativity of how you integrate and manage multiple data sources. The only front-end requirement is that your UI properly display the mulitple data sources.

**Happy coding!**
